<h3 align="center">Welcome to Hacktoberfest@JUET 2020!</h3>
Hacktoberfest is a monthlong celebration of open source software, run by DigitalOcean and supported by Intel, Dev, GitHub, JetBrains, CircleCI, Vonage, MLH, Progate, Indeed and many more.
Submit 4 valid pull requests and aside from the knowledge you’ll gain (and the fun you’ll have), you’ll also receive a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt along with some amazing swags. This year, you can choose to go green by getting a tree planted instead of opting for a T-shirt and swags.
